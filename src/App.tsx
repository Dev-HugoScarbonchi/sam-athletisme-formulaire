Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and parentheses added:

```javascript
// At line 1089, add missing closing bracket for the try block
          break;
        }

// At line 1091, add missing closing bracket for the if statement checking response.ok
      }

// At line 1093, add missing closing bracket for the for loop
    }

// At line 1095, add missing closing brace for the handleSubmit function
  };

// At line 1097, add missing closing brace for the App component
}

// At line 1099, add missing closing brace for the error logging object
      };

```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for a try block
2. Missing closing bracket for an if statement checking response.ok
3. Missing closing bracket for a for loop
4. Missing closing brace for the handleSubmit function
5. Missing closing brace for the App component
6. Missing closing brace for the error logging object

The code should now be properly balanced with all brackets and braces closed.
